		<h1>Questions and Answers</h1>
		<h2>Travel and accomodations:</h2>
		<p>Will there be some kind of organized transfer? No, we'll just meet at the church at 13:15.</p>
		<p>Where can I park?Parking is free on the weekends in the 1st district. The locations are close to each other so you won't need your car.</p>
		<p> How can I get home at night? The 916 bus is in service all night at the castle and it hits every major traffic hub in the city.</p>
		<h2>Food and festivities:</h2>
		<p>I'd like to do some kind of surprise for you guys at the party. To whom should I talk about this? Discuss it with Abigail Smith. Just drop her an email at abigail@awesomemail.com.</p>
		<p>What should I wear? Do you have a dress code? Wear what's comfortable to you. If it helps smart casual / business casual for the ladies and smart casual / informal for the gentlemen are perfect options.</p>
    <p>I would like some kind of special food (gluten-free, lactose-free, vegan etc.) Drop us a line here and we'll find a way.</p>
		<h2>Other small stuff:</h2>
		<p>I have a problem / question on the wedding day. With whom can I speak? Jared Wright on this number: +36 30 000 0000.</p>
		<p>Can we bring kids? Sure! We planned a whole toy / sweets corner for them.</p>
   	<p>How do you feel about dogs? Can I bring mine? We love dogs and you can absolutely bring yours. The Heaven Lounge is a dog-friendly place.</p>
